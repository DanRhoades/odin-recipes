    <p><h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>onion , finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot , peeled and very finely diced</li>
        <li>1 celery stick , very finely diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>1 kg / 2 lb beef mince</li>
        <li>800g / 28 oz canned crushed tomato</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup pinot noir red wine , or other dry red wine</li>
        <li>3 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves , dried or fresh</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp EACH dried thyme and oregano</li>
        <li>2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt and black pepper</li></ul></p>
        <p><h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2></p>
        <p><h3><strong>Ragu</strong></h3>
            <p><ol><li> Heat in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
            <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
            <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
            <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required </li></ol></p>
            <p><h3><strong>Cheese Sauce</strong></h3></p>
            <ol><li>milk up in a saucepan (optional just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering, see video). If its too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li></ol>
            <p><h3><strong>Assemble</strong></h3></p>
            <p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
                <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.</li>
                <li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.</li>
                <li>Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.</li>
                <li>Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.</li>
                <li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
                <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.</li></p>
